/* Vickrey Auction Rules (Blockchain ver.) 
------------------------------------------------
STAGE I -- Bid:
- A bidder cannot be the seller.
- A bidder should bid only one price. The price must be at least the `reservePrice`.
- Bidders submit encrypted bids so that no one else knows it until they reveal.
- Along with the bid, a bidder must deposit some value (note that deposit is not bid -- the deposit is not a secret!)
- Don't miss the bid deadline.

STAGE II -- Reveal:
- A bidder cannot reveal until the bid deadline, but please don't miss the reveal deadline either.
- The bid revealed must match the encrypted version (and no more than the deposit for sure) to be considered valid.
- If a bidder do not reveal their bid in time, they'll be regarded as they did not bid at all.

STAGE III -- Decide the Winner:
- The bidder with the highest price wins the auction, but only pays the seller for the second highest price.
- After the reveal deadline, everyone who revealed can withdraw the overpayed part of their deposit.
- Corner case 1: When there's a tie, the bidder who reveals first wins. So I would say reveal as soon as you can!
- Corner case 2: When there's only one valid bidder, they wins and pays for the `reservePrice`.
- Corner case 3: When there's no valid bidder, nobody wins. The seller can then withdraw their item.
